            In this fictional world set in early 20th century Taishō-era Japan,
            man-eating demons roam the land each night. 13-year-old Tanjiro

            Nezuko—who has turned into a demon. Determined to avenge their

            organization of skilled fighters who dedicate their lives to

            The series focuses on Asta, a young orphan who is left to be raised
            in an orphanage alongside his fellow orphan, Yuno. While everyone is
            born with the ability to utilize mana in the form of magical power,
            Asta, with no magic however, instead focuses on physical strength.
            Conversely, Yuno was born as a prodigy with immense magical power
            and the talent to control wind magic. Motivated by a desire to
            become the next Wizard King, an authority figure second to the king
            of Clover Kingdom, the two youths developed a friendly rivalry. Yuno
            obtains a legendary four-leaf grimoire held by the kingdom's first
            Wizard King. The four-leaf grimoire is a rare grimoire, only given
            to the most immense mages. Asta, despite his lack of magic, obtained
            a mysterious five-leaf grimoire that contains mysterious elf swords
            and a bodiless member of the Devil race who utilizes rare
            anti-magic. Afterward, he and Yuno each join a Magic Knight squad as
            the first step to fulfill their ambitions.
